If You are reading this, then welcome to my Java1 repo.
This repo is simply for me to keep track of my work while I learn how to build API's with Codecademy.

The MainProjects directory are where I followed the guidance and references provided. These scripts have plenty of comments that explain what the code is actually doing.

The LookMamaNoHands (Lmnh) directory has  basically the same projects as MainProjects but I completed them with no guidance or reference, these projects do not contain any comments.

The scripts labeled "Piat" (Putting it all together) are my finally projects where I take everything I have learnt and put it all into making one programwhich I have also completed with now guidance or reference. LmnhPiat will be in the written in filename.

Thanks for reading, and if your new to Java I hope you learn something from these projects.

Happy Coding :)
