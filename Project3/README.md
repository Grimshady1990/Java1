This simple calculator does simple 2 parameter equations such as (5+7).
To use simply us either of the following:
.add = addition
.sub = subtraction
.div = division
.multi = multiply
.modulo = modulo(remainder)

I have made a variable called myCalc please reference the example usage below:

System.out.println(myCalc.multi(10, 20));

This will print 200.0
